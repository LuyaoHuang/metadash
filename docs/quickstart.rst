Quick start
====================================

If you want to try out metadash quickly, you can start your own development instance with a few command:

after you clone the repo, just run:

    .. code-block:: shell

        bin/md-manager setup

then

    .. code-block:: shell

        bin/md-manager runserver

Now you have a Metadash development instance running on port 5000, visit http://localhost:5000 to try it.

Or you can use docker-compose for a better experience:

# TODO: docker-compose.yml
